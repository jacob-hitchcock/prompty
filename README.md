# Prompty: Connecting Distant Immigrant Families

Prompty is an Informatics Capstone Project aimed at addressing the acculturation gap and cultivating relationships between distant immigrant families. Our goal is to provide a convenient way for families to preserve and share aspects of their life, language, and tradition with one another, despite living far away from each other.

## The Problem

Generations of immigrant families have become disconnected due to the distance between them. There is currently no convenient way to preserve and share aspects of your life, language, and tradition with your family members. This generational disconnect is resulting in second-generation children losing sight of their heritage and feeling rootless as they try to balance the culture they have grown up in and the culture of their family members. Many family members, especially those who did not grow up together also have little to no knowledge of one another past the surface-level which further creates a gap. With online applications being the primary way to communicate long-distance, it can be difficult to know what to talk about, especially when you barely know the relative. Language barriers make it even harder to get to know someone online as you may have to have someone translate each conversation for you.

## Our Solution

Our solution is a platform that helps immigrant families connect and preserve their traditions and culture. Prompty provides containers and prompts of ideas for what you can share so you and your family can grow your connections. With our platform, families can easily share their memories, recipes, songs, and more. They can even store family photos and videos in one convenient location. Our platform is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, even for those who are not tech-savvy.
